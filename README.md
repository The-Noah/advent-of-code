# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

## GitHub Copilot

I normally use [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) to help write code; however to keep the spirit of the puzzles I have not used it for any of these solutions.
